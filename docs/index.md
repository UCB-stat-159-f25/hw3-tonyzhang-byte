# LIGO Tutorial Homework 3

This site packages the LIGO open data tutorial for STAT 159/259 Homework 3. It contains a reproducible notebook, supporting utilities, and guidance on running the analysis locally or in the cloud.

[![Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tonyzhang-byte/hw3-tonyzhang-byte/HEAD?labpath=docs/notebooks/LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb)

```{admonition} Quick Start
- Launch the notebook on Binder using the badge above.
- Clone the repository and run `make env` followed by `make html` to reproduce the build locally.
- Generated figures are stored in `figures/`, audio files in `audio/`, and processed data in `data/`.
```

```{tip}
The notebook is available directly from the navigation bar under **Notebook**. Use the Binder badge to experiment without installing anything locally.
```
